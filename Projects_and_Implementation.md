1-> Create a local Kubernetes cluster and configure multiple nodes with defined resource capacities. Deploy an application using a Deployment controller so that Kubernetes schedules the pods on nodes with available resources. Run the application locally and continuously send traffic to it. When one node runs out of resources, Kubernetes should automatically schedule new pods on another node that has sufficient capacity.
